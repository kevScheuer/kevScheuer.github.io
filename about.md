# About Me

Hi, I'm Kevin Scheuer! I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in experimental nuclear / particle physics, where I'm working to uncover the properties of particles through the complex interactions of "partial waves". People often think physicists purely work with pencils and papers all day, but 99% of my work is coding and data analysis. When I'm not researching I'm typically reading, cross-stitching, or cooking! I also *love* video games and their intricacies, like how moveset frame data impacts character viability in *Super Smash Bros. Melee*. 

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-scheuer/) or over email <scheuer.ks@gmail.com> to discuss science, hobbies, or anything in between!
