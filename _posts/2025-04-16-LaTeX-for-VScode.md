*Pretty neat, right?*

## Introduction
What you just saw above was the ability to save an article off the web, and immediately begin citing it in your paper with easy visuals for viewing changes to your work. By the end of this article you'll have this and *much* more at your fingertips to make your thesis, or any scientific writing, a breeze. This guide will show you how to configure Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Zotero together to work automatically, and track your paper's version history with git, along with a few other conveniences. And if you're hesitant to take the jump away from Overleaf, consider the following:
1. This guide will give you the ability to compile LaTeX entirely locally
2. Git integration means easy collaboration + neat version history (something overleaf *tries* to do and even locks most of it behind a paywall)
3. No more compilation timeouts
4. Fully customizable environment

### Pre-requisites
This guide is aimed at macOS users, see the [References](#references) section for Windows help. Below is some other requirements:
* A free [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) account, with the [desktop app and browser "connecter" extension](https://www.zotero.org/download/)
