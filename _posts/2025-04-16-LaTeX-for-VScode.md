## Introduction
What you just above was the ability to save an article off the web, and immediately begin citing it in your paper with easy visuals to view changes to your work. By the end of this article you'll have this and *much* more at your fingertips to make your thesis, or any scientific writing, a breeze. This guide will show you how to configure Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Zotero together to work automatically, and track your paper's version history with Git(Hub), along with a few other conveniences. I assume you have a basic familiarity with Zotero, but may be entirely new to VS Code and git.
